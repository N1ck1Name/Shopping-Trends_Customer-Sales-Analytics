# Shopping-Trends_Customer-Sales-Analytics
I analyze customer behavior in a retail store: demographics, product categories, discounts, payment methods, and subscriptions. The goal is to find out who brings in the most money, how discounts/subscriptions affect it, and which products are worth promoting.

Our questions ?

1. Who are our customers by demographics (age, gender, regions)?
2. Which categories and products bring in the most revenue?
3. How do discounts, promo codes, subscriptions, and payment methods affect the purchase amount?
4. How does customer behavior (purchase frequency, “Previous Purchases”) relate to spending?
5. Is there seasonality in purchases (Season, Category, Color)?
